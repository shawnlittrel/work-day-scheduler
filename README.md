# Work Day Scheduler

**Description**
---
This simple daily schedule was laid out in HTML, designed in Bootstrap and custom CSS, and programmed with JavaScript.  jQuery and moment.js were utilized as well to simplify coding and manipulating dates and times.

The user is greeted with the current date and time at the top of the screen, and a daily schedule with blocks of time from 7am to 6pm.  As the day progresses, the current hour is shown in red, highlighting what needs to be done immediately.  Anything still in the future is green, while items in the past are grey.

Next to each time block is a blue save button, which saves the schedule to local storage and allows it to persist throughout the day.  The schedule is automatically cleared each day to allow the user to start with a blank slate each morning.

Next to develop is a datepicker so that a user can keep track of more than one day at a time, with the option of going back to previous days to check for missed tasks.  I will also be removing the save button in favor of automatically saving each item after input in order to prevent lost work.
